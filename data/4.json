    "text": "This buttery soft and breathable organic cotton weighted blanket is ideal for all seasons. Weighted blankets have been medically proven to aid naturally deeper sleep cycles. The weight on your body stimulates the production of serotonin (the happy hormone), reduces cortisol (the stress hormone), and increases melatonin, which helps you fall (and stay) asleep. Your Napper should be roughly 10% of your body weight (e.g. 70kg body weight = 7kg Napper).",
